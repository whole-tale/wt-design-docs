Domain Case Studies
=====================

This section documents detailed case studies of domains that inform the Whole
Tale platform design. When looking at a particular discipline or sub-discipline,
we explore the following questions:

* What is the state of computational reproducibility?
* What do associations/societies and top journals say about data/code sharing?
* Are related initiatives driving by motivated researchers or editors? 
* Have they implemented or are they considering badging of verification?
* Why is the field different from others we've studied?
* Are there examples of existing "tales" (e.g., research compendia)
* Are there relationships with other open science infrastructure projects?
