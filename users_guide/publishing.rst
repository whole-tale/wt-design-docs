Publishing Tales
================

When your Tale is ready to be preserved and shared, you can publish it to external repositories. When you publish your Tale, it receives a DOI that can be cited by others.

Publishers
----------

Zenodo
^^^^^^
Zenodo is a general purpose data repository that's run by CERN. Zenodo allows
for objects up to 50gb and can mint DOIs. Zenodo also offers the ability to version 
data submissions, which is supported in Whole Tale's system.

.. note::
   Before publishing to production servers, it's recommended to first publish to
   the Zenodo sandbox repository.

Publishing Your Tale
--------------------

To publish your Tale, select "Publish Tale" from the dropdown menu on the Run page.

If you haven't connected any third-party accounts the list will be empty. For instructions how to connect your account, visit
the settings page.

Viewing Publishing Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After you've published your tale, you can always view the published location under the metadata tab on the Run page.

Updating Published Tales
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case that the published tale needs to be published again, with the intent of overwriting the previous publication, 
it can be updated by re-publishing to the same repository. This feature is only available to tales under the user's ownership. 

If a tale was used for related, subsequent work and shouldn't update the previous tale, a new tale should be created by 
first copying the tale. When the copied tale is published, it will be a completely new record.
