Confirmable Reproducible Research Environment (CORE2)
=====================================================

The `Confirmable Reproducible Research Environment (CORE2) <https://http://core2project.org/>`_
is an effort of the `Odum Institute for Research in Social Science <https://odum.unc.edu/>`_
to develop a platform for managing the curation and verification of computational artifacts 
associated with peer-reviewed research. 

The project builds on Odum's years of experience curating and verifying research artifacts 
submitted to high-profile journals in the field of political science. CORE2 implements curation 
and verification workflows that are outside the scope of traditional manuscript review systems.
This includes roles for journal editors, authors, data curators, and verifiers. In the CORE2
system, data curators are responsible for reviewing submitted materials for adherence to 
journal policies and verifiers are responsible for confirming that provided artifacts can
be used to obtain the results reported in the accompanying manuscript.

As part of an ongoing collaboration, CORE2 is being integrated with Whole Tale, leveraging the 
following capabilities:

- Shared authentication via Globus Auth
- Creation and management of Tales and versions associated with manuscripts under review
- Creation and management of computational environments, including licensed software such as STATA and MATLAB.
- Sharing and access control
