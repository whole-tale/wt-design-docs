	abstract = {In this paper we describe our experience adopting the Research Object Bundle (RO-Bundle) format with BagIt serialization (BagIt-RO) for the design and implementation of "tales" in the Whole Tale platform. A tale is an executable research object intended for the dissemination of computational scientific findings that captures information needed to facilitate understanding, transparency, and re-execution for review and computational reproducibility at the time of publication. We describe the Whole Tale platform and requirements that led to our adoption of BagIt-RO, specifics of our implementation, and discuss migrating to the emerging Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) standard.},

	abstract = {Whole Tale http://wholetale.org is a web-based, open-source platform for reproducible research supporting the creation, sharing, execution, and verification of "Tales" for the scientific research community. Tales are executable research objects that capture the code, data, and environment along with narrative and workflow information needed to re-create computational results from scientific studies. Creating reproducible research objects that enable reproducibility, transparency, and re-execution for computational experiments requiring significant compute resources or utilizing massive data is an especially challenging open problem. We describe opportunities, challenges, and solutions to facilitating reproducibility for data- and compute-intensive research, that we call "Tales at Scale," using the Whole Tale computing platform. We highlight challenges and solutions in frontend responsiveness needs, gaps in current middleware design and implementation, network restrictions, containerization, and data access. Finally, we discuss challenges in packaging computational experiment implementations for portable data-intensive Tales and outline future work.},

We evaluate our guidance in light of the recent National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM, 2019) report on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science recommendation for journal reproducibility audits. We present 10 findings that clarify how reproducibility initiatives contend with a variety of social and technical factors, including significant gaps in editorial infrastructure and a lack of uniformity in how research artifacts are packaged for dissemination. We propose and define a novel concept of assessable reproducible research artifacts and point the way to an improved understanding of how changes to author incentives and dissemination requirements impact the quality, rigor, and trustworthiness of published computational research.}, number={4}, journal={Harvard Data Science Review}, publisher={PubPub}, author={Willis, Craig and Stodden, Victoria}, year={2020}, month={Dec}, language={en} }
