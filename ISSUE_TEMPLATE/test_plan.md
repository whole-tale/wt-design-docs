### Analyze in Whole Tale


#### Task 1: Importing a Dataset from Dataverse

These test cases cover potential situations that can occur when importing datasets from Dataverse.

* [ ] Case 1: Ideal Scenario:

Testing Steps:
   1. Remove all running Tale instances
   2. Navigate to https://girder.stage.wholetale.org/api/v1/integration/dataverse?datasetPid=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2F3MJ7IR&siteUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdataverse.harvard.edu
   3. Confirm that the Tale title reads as ``Replication Data for: "Agricultural Fires and Health at Birth"``
   4. Confirm that the only item in the ``Selected data`` section matches the uri with ``Data Source`` appended 
   5. Confirm that no environment is selected
   6. Confirm that the ``Create New Tale and Launch`` button is disabled
   7. Select an environment
   8. Click ``Create New Tale and Launch``
   10. Confirm that you are redirected to the run page
   11. Confirm that the Tale name matches the Tale Name in the Create Tale Modal
   12. Confirm that the data exists in the Tale Workspace and **not** under External Data

#### Task 2: Importing a Dataset from DataONE

These test cases cover different scenarios that may happen when importing datasets from DataONE.

* [ ] Case 1: Ideal Scenario:

This test covers the ideal case where dataset importing has all of the needed information 
to properly run. This includes the dataset location, title, and selected environment.

Testing Steps:
   1. Remove all running Tale instances
   2. Navigate to https://girder.stage.wholetale.org/api/v1/integration/dataone?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsearch.dataone.org%2Fview%2Fdoi%3A10.18739%2FA2VQ2S94D&title=Fire%20influences%20on%20forest%20recovery%20and%20associated%20climate%20feedbacks%20in%20Siberian%20Larch%20Forests%2C%20Russia&environment=RStudio
   3. Confirm that the Tale title reads as ``Fire influences on forest recovery and associated climate feedbacks in Siberian Larch Forests, Russia``
   4. Confirm that the only item in the ``Selected data`` section matches the uri with ``Data Source`` appended
   5. Confirm that ``Rstudio`` is selected in the Environments widget
   6. Confirm that the ``Create New Tale and Launch`` button is enabled
   7. Click ``Create New Tale and Launch``
   9. Confirm that you are redirected to the run page
   10. Confirm that the Tale name matches the Tale Name in the Create Tale Modal
   11. Confirm that the data exists in the Tale under External Data

#### Task 3: Shared Behavior

These cases show errors that are common between Dataverse and DataONE. Although they are tested using DataONE URIs, the errors should be the same when replacing it with a Dataverse URI.

* [ ] Case 1: Missing Data Location Query Param:


The test covers the case where the dataset location is missing as a query parameter. This query parameter is used to let the UI know 
that we're importing a dataset/Tale. If it is missing, the default Compose page should be observed.

Testing Steps:
   1. Remove all running Tale instances
   2. Navigate to https://dashboard.stage.wholetale.org/browse?uri=
   3. Confirm that the Tale title is blank
   4. Confirm that the ``Selected data`` section is blank
   5. Confirm that no environment is selected
   6. Confirm that the ``Create New Tale and Launch`` button is disabled

* [ ] Case 2: Missing Dataset Title Query Param:

This test covers the case where the name query parameter is missing. The expected behavior is 
that the uri query parameter is used instead.

Testing Steps:
   1. Remove all running Tale instances
   2. Navigate to https://dashboard.stage.wholetale.org/browse?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdataverse.harvard.edu%2Fapi%2Faccess%2Fdatafile%2F3323458
   3. Confirm that the Tale title reads as ``https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/3323458``
   4. Confirm that the only item in the ``Selected data`` section matches the uri with ``Data Source`` appended
   5. Confirm that no Environment is selected
   6. Confirm that the ``Create New Tale and Launch`` button is disabled
   7. Select an environment
   8. Click ``Create New Tale and Launch``
   9. Confirm that the notification bar appears & properly updates
   10. Confirm that you are redirected to the run page
   11. Confirm that the Tale name matches the Tale Name in the Create Tale Modal
   12. Confirm that the data exists in the Tale under External Data
